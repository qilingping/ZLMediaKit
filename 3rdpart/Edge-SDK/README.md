## What is the DJI Edge SDK?

DJI Edge SDK is an edge computing development kit for DJI Dock, providing the following functions:

* Manages aircraft media files
* Subscribes to aircraft live streams
* Provides secure local communication links
* Supports SDK interconnections

## Features

### Subscribe to Aircraft Live Streams
Allowing real-time video recognition and other AI processes for aircraft-transmitted data streams on local system, which greatly enhances aircraft intelligence, and provides better support for aircraft mission execution.

### Manage Aircraft Media Files
Enables fetching and processing media files captured by aircraft to local system for refined recognition and data filtering. This reduces cloud traffic and latency and enhances data processing efficiency.

### Provide Secure Local Communication Links
Edge computing offers a secure local communication link, ensuring communication safety and privacy protection between aircraft. This avoids risks of network attacks and data breaches during aircraft communication.

### Support SDK Interconnections
Edge computing can process and transmit data in unstable network environments, utilizing small data channels to enhance transmission efficiency. This ensures aircraft achieve efficient data processing and transmission across various environments.
